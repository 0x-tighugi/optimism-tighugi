The cannon (cannon cannon cannon) is an on chain interactive fraud prover
It's half geth, half of what I think truebit was supposed to be
When it's done, we'll be able to prove L1 blocks aren't fraud

1. Get minigeth to verify a block locally paying attention to oracle
2. Compile embedded minigeth 
3. Get embedded minigeth to verify a block using the oracle

...and then there's more stuff, but just that for now
